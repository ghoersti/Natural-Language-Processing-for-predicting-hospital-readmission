# Natural-Language-Processing-for-predicting-hospital-readmission
A predictive model built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify patients at the risk of readmission.

## Processing Phases
Due to the Limited resources for our project we divided our processng into 3 phases **Pre-Azure** ,**Azure**,**Post-Azure**

**Pre Azure**

Minor Preprocessing, change delimiter. 

**Azure**

Data Processing, tokenize features(heavy lifting) and  create label.

**Post Aure**

Vectorize features, implement ML models
